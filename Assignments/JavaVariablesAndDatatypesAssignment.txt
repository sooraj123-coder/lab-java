Q1- What is statically typed and dynamically typed Programming Language;
Statically typed : means the programmer has to define the type of variable while decalring it for the very first time, like int data;
here in the above example I have declared variable data with int type. java is Statically typed language.

Dynamically typed language : In these programming languages programmer does not required to specify the type of variable while declarng it for the first type the type is automatically identified by the 
type of data stored in that variable, like data="PW College"
here in the above example I have not defined the type of variable even though the programming language will automatically identifu=y its type based on the value stored in it.

Q2- what is variable in java;
Variable is nothing but a named memory location in RAM which stores some value as per its defined type.
like int data=45;
Data is a variable.

Q3- How To Assign a Value To Variable?
We assign value to variable using the Assignment operator(=). The value to be stored is specified at the right side of the (=)operator and
variable on the left side.

Q4- what are primitive data types in java?
the data types which are inbuilt in java laguage are called primitive data types. we can directly use them to create varaiable.
example : byte, short, int, long, float, double

Q5- what are identifiers in java?
Identifiers are the fundamental building block of any programming laguage, Identifier can any name give to class, variable, method, anything that helps to identify little things in programs.

Q6- List the operators in java?
Arithmetic - -, +, /, %, * 
Logical -  !, ||, &&
Relational - ==, <=, >=, !=, <>, <, >
Btiwise - |, &, ~, ^ 
Shift - <<, >>, >>>
Assignment - =
Unary - --, ++
Ternary - (conditiona)?true section:false section

Q7- explain about increment and decrement operator give examples?

decrement operator = --, used to decrease the value of variable used along with it by 1
Increment operator = ++, used to increase the value of variable used along with it by 1

there are two categories of increment and decrement operators
1- prefix - rule -> change then use
2- postfix - rule -> use then change

example: 
Public class Example{

    public static void main(String args[]){
        int a=10;
        int b=10;

        System.out.println(" a incremented using prefix increment ++a = "+ ++a);
        System.out.println(" b incremented using postfix increment b++ = "+ b++);
    }
}
         

    output - a incremented using prefix increment ++a = 11
             b incremented using postfix increment b++ = 10 //though the value of b is incremented but it will still print 10 if you again print the b then the new value will be 11
